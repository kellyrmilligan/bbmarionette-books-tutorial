bbmarionette-books-tutorial
===========================

A re-implementation of the books tutorial by David Sulc using the AMD build of Marionette. Uses require js, the AMD build of Marionette, and handlebars as the templating language.

Also using lodash in place of underscore js. 

See:

http://davidsulc.com/blog/2012/05/06/tutorial-a-full-backbone-marionette-application-part-1/
and
http://davidsulc.com/blog/2012/05/13/tutorial-a-full-backbone-marionette-application-part-2/

for the original tutorial.

Since this is using requirejs to load the templates, you will need to run this sample app from a local web server.
